Problem description: 
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of 
two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Solution: The product of two three-digit numbers is always 6 digits. 
A six digit palindrome has the form ijkkji. We can make a nested loop to start 
with the largest possible palindrome (999999) and work our way down until we find
a palindrome that has two whole number factors. The two whole number factors
are 913 and 993, and their product is the palindrome 906609.
